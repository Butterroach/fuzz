# fuzz

## literally the worst language

### docs

fuzz is interpreted. it is written in python.

the only thing possible in this is printing stuff to the console. NOTHING ELSE.

example code:

```
echo Hello, world!;
```

"what about the errors", you say? there are errors but it won't tell you what the fuck went wrong!
less debuggable, more fun!

### why?

uhhh idk

### how to use

download the interpreter.py file and make a .fuzz file containing your code, run interpreter.py with the .fuzz file as your argument, and kaboom!

you can also run interpreter.py without any arguments to launch an interactive shell (which gets interpreted the same way files are btw)

### are there even any benefits

it's lightweight ig..?
