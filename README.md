# fuzz

## literally the worst language

### docs

fuzz is interpreted. it is written in python.

the only thing possible in this is printing stuff to the console. NOTHING ELSE.

example code:

```
echo Hello, world!;
```

"what about the errors", you say? there are errors but it won't tell you what the fuck went wrong!
less debuggable, more fun!

### why?

uhhh idk

### how to use

download the interpreter.py file and make a .fuzz file containing your code, run interpreter.py with the .fuzz file as your argument, and kaboom!

### are there even any benefits

it's lightweight ig..?
